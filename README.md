### Welcome! I have a few simple questions for you:

  * *Do you study human genetics, genomics, or cell/molecular biology?*

  * *Do you enjoy aesthetically pleasing figures and slides involving human chromosomes, but making them yourself is too much work?*  

  * *Have you ever wished for a library of human chromosomes for drag-and-drop figure and slide creation?*  

If any of the above describe you, **look no further**!  You may be in luck.

### What's in the Box?  
  

This repository contains image files for each of the 24 primary human chromosomes, as well as one for the entire genome lined up.  These files are provided in four formats, organized into subdirectories based on file type:  
1. `illustrator` contains Adobe Illustrator files, and are suffixed with `.ai`
2. `pdf` contains pdf files, and are suffixed with `.pdf`  
3. `png` contains png image files, and are suffixed with `.png`
4. `vector` contains vector graphics files, and are suffixed with `.svg`  
     
  
### Disclaimers  
  * All chromosome lengths and cytoband positions are approximately--but not precisely--to scale. They should be correct when compared to rough microscopic resolution, but not to the exact pixel or nucleotide.  
  * Some cytobands have been omitted in the interest of visual aesthetics.
